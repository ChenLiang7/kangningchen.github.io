		<h2>Iceland Trip</h2>
		<h3>Where I stayed</h3>
		<p>Answers to questions 2, 3, and 6: (2) The video control bars in Safari, Chrome and Firefox all look different from each other. Moreover, while in Safari the DOB field is a blank field just like the name field, Chrome's and Firefox's DOB fields have mm/dd/yyyy showing in the fields and when clicked a calendar would pop up, from which user can select a date that would then populate the field. (3) No, it doesn't. Focus indicator is important because it's incredibly difficult for people who use a keyboard to navigate web pages to know which element is being focused on if the focus indicator is removed.</p>
