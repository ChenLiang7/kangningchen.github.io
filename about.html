			<h1>Hi! I'm Kangning.</h1>
			<h2>I'm a policy-analyst-turned programmer who works at the intersection of policy research and analytics.</h2>
			<p>Iâ€™m a first year Master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) specializing in Data Science. My background, however, was in International Relations. I completed my undergrad at Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service in 2015 with a major in International Political Economy and a honors certificate in International Business Diplomacy.<p> 
			<p>Upon graduation, I worked at a government policy research firm based in Washington DC, where I witnessed time and again the stark failure of traditional data-driven forecasting. The world woke up in shock to the news that the United Kingdom had voted to leave the European Union. A Trump victory again rocked the world, after widespread predictions of a landslide Clinton win. In both cases, major media and polls had failed to predict the outcomes. Nevertheless, some social media and Google searches revealed a glimpse of results pointing in the correct direction. Questions started to crowd my head. Did these events render traditional polling methods obsolete? What are the benefits of new big data measures incorporating social media and online searches over traditional forecasting metrics? How can we properly collect, store, process, analyze, and interpret massive amounts of data to inform forecasting and analysis? These questions intrigued me and drove me to UMSI to pursue a degree in Information Science. </p> 
			<p>At UMSI, I'm taking a wide variety of classes ranging from statistics to web development to database application design. To know more about my degree, please click <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/content/msi">here</a>.</p>
			<p>When I'm not thinking and talking about policy and data science. I'm constantly on the road. I love hiking and traveling. Click <a href="travel.html">here</a> to check out where I've been!<p>
